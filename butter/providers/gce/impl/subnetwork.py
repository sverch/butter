Butter Subnetwork on GCE

This is a the GCE implmentation for the subnetwork API, a high level interface to manage groups of
subnets.  This is mainly for internal use, as the instances API is the real high level interface.

This is also in flux because of the differences between how cloud providers manage subnetworks, so
it might go away.
