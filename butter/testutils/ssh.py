Utilities for spinning up a machine with a temporary SSH key installed.

This is trickier than you might expect, for the core reason that everything that could possibly get
a new SSH key on the machine must be baked into the image.

For starters, the provider specific SSH setup depends on what is already installed on the image.
Take for example the AWS keypairs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html).  For images already
supported by AWS, keypairs work fine, but for custom images special setup must be done to explicitly
pull down and set up the SSH keys.  I haven't found anyone running into this yet explicitly, so I'd
have to verify myself, but I can't think of any other way it could possibly work.

Second, even executing scripts at startup are custom features baked into the provided AMIs.  See:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26158411/amazon-ec2-custom-ami-not-running-bootstrap-user-data.

The GCE docs show a good example of all the steps that must actually be set up for a custom image:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/import-existing-image.  No SSH keys or startup script
execution is included.

So in summary, everything related to setting up SSH access depends on whatever software is already
installed on the image.  This means that anything injecting a temporary SSH keypair cross cloud and
in a way that can support custom images must be extremely flexible.
