instance groups can communicate.  The abstraction it provides is a graph, and it
does the transformation to and from the underlying firewall rules.

    Butter Paths Client Object

    This is the object through which all path related calls are made.

    Usage:

        import butter
        client = butter.Client(provider, credentials)
        internal_service = client.service.get(network, "internal_service")
        load_balancer = client.service.get(network, "load_balancer")

        client.paths.add(internet, load_balancer, 443)
        client.paths.list()
        client.graph()

    The above commands will result in the public internet having access to "load_balancer" on port
